## Hi there 👋

We are team of enthusiastic individuals working towards a common goal of preserving and promoting local indigeneous languages.
The data used in our projects are solely public domain and we cross verify to maintain their integrity.
We intend to promote the cultural aspects associated with the language as well instead of just the language itself.

🍿 Fun fact - `Language is the carrier of culture.`


🌈 Contribution guidelines - If you know any way you could help aid the cause, be it code or contributing your knowledge regarding the indgineous language on talk, do reach out to us through our email handle or open pull requests on the applicaiton code base.


🍿 Fun fact - We work totally offline as of now, providing access to crucial information and heatmap visualized linguistics data without active network connections,
although we do have plans with a connected future of the platform with access to community activities like chatrooms and discussion forums as well as newsletter subscriptions.
